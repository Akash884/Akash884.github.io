				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal computers having Windows operating system installed in it are one of the most popular tech gadget across the globe. The windows operating system is probably the most user friendly operating system which can be used for different tasks ranging from editing a text file to use in industrial devices like ATM machines, cash registers etc. For a layman, Windows is more user friendly than other operating systems like UNIX, IOS etc… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you are using Windows, it is likely that you must  be familiar with various files of the Windows Operating System. Even then there are some .exe files that look confusing and can be suspicious to be a virus. One such executable file is the dwm.exe. Here in this article we will discuss about this file and will try to clear any doubts regarding dwm.exe file. We have already discussed about <a href="https://devsjournal.com/what-is-rundll32-exe-why-is-it-running-on-your-system-faqs.html">rundll32.exe</a>, <a href="https://devsjournal.com/what-is-service-host-process-svchost-exe-and-why-is-it-running-so-many-times.html">svchost.exe</a> and dllhost.exe</span></p>

<h2><b>WHAT IS DWM.exe?</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29903" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DWM-Desktop-Window-Manager.jpg" alt="DWM Desktop Window Manager" width="815" height="375" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DWM-Desktop-Window-Manager.jpg 815w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DWM-Desktop-Window-Manager-150x69.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DWM-Desktop-Window-Manager-300x138.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DWM-Desktop-Window-Manager-768x353.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DWM-Desktop-Window-Manager-750x345.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular Windows user must seen some advanced graphic effects like transparent windows, live taskbar thumbnails, Flip 3D etc. in their computer systems. Well these effects don’t just for no reasons. There is a specific composite window manager in the operating system that renders such pretty effects. This composite window by name is known as Desktop Window Manager(dwm.exe).</span></p>
<blockquote class="pullquote align-center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dwm.exe is a Microsoft Windows system file and it is responsible for the Desktop Window Manage, Desktop Window manager (DWM, previously Desktop Compositing Engine or DCE) is the window manager in Windows OS that enabled the use of hardware acceleration to render the graphical user interface of Windows.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different applications run in the computer system. These applications do not draw the display directly in the screen. Instead, they write a picture of the window in a specific memory location. The operating system then creates a composite view of all the windows before sending them to the monitor. Because of this, the OS can tag on visual effects like transparency and window animation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These graphical and visual effects in your Windows system is rendered by the dwm.exe file. </span></p>
<h3><b>What does the exe in dwm.exe mean?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have known that dwm stands for desktop window manager, you should be curious to know what the .exe in the file name actually means. WORRY NOT. We will explain about that too.</span></p>
<h4>What are .exe files?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have answered almost half of your question.

<p><b>1. What is the use of dwm.exe file?<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This question has been already answered. However, to mention once again, dwm.exe files are responsible for the graphical effects that can be seen in your Windows computer.</span></b></p>
<p><b>2. Is dwm.exe a virus?<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The simplest answer to this question is </span>No<span style="font-weight: 400;">. dwm.exe is a very much essential component of Windows system.

Though it&#8217;s very unlikely, we cannot rule out such possibilities.</span></b></p>
<p><b>3. Can I disable or remove dwm.exe?<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No, you cannot. This was earlier possible with Windows Vista, where the desktop window manager was controlled by a service that can be turned off. However , from Windows 7, Desktop Window Manager has became a vital and integral part of the Windows system.</span></b></p>
<p><b>4. How to check if dwm.exe is disguising as virus?</b><b><br />
</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, virus may sometimes sometimes create executable files with the same name i.e. dwm.exe and disguise as the original file. In such a case, have a look at the task manager and check the file location of the process. If it is Windows\System32 folder, then you can be certain that it is not a virus.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><b>EXE ERRORS AND COMMON dwm.exe ERROR MESSAGES</b></h3>
<p><b></b><b>REASONS OF EXE ERRORS:</b></p>
<p>The most obvious reason for occurence of an exe error is the vulnerability of exe files to virus and malwares. Often viruses distributed through emails or websites will disguise as a benign exe file and infect the computer system.</p>

</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>SOLUTION FOR HIGH USAGE OF RAM AND CPU BY DWM.EXE :</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dwm,exe process is usually not likely to use high RAM and CPU resources. You can rarely see dwm.exe using more than 1% CPU and 50 MB RAM. However, in certain cases, the uses may go high. Yet in such cases , the usage will eventually settle down after a period of time. Occasionally if the dwm.exe is eating up more RAM and CPU, you can take the following steps or measures to solve the problem.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update the graphics card and video card adapter divers.</span></li>

<h3><b>HOW TO FIX DWM.EXE ERRORS</b>?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, you must now be curious enough to learn how to resolve the problems caused by faulty or malicious dwm.exe file . Let’s have a look at the below steps which you can follow in order to troubleshoot your computer from the errors caused by dwm.exe file.</span></p>
<p><b>STEP 1: REPAIR REGISTRY ENTRIES.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most exe errors can be attributed to wrong entries in the registry. Most of the times the dwm.exe file is shared by several programs. In later times if any of such programs are uninstalled, invalid entries still remain in the registry. What this actually means is that while the path of the file has changed, an incorrect record of the same still exists in the registry. While windows try to look into these incorrect references , a dwm.exe error occurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While fixing this error, it is recommended that the registry entries should not be manually edited unless you are PC service professional. This is because the small mistake in the editing may cause the complete system become nonfunctional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this risk it is highly recommended that you use a trusted registry cleaner for scanning and repairing the registry entries. Using a registry cleaner, one can easily automate the process of finding invalid registry entries, missing references and broken links within the registry. One such registry cleaner that you may check is WinThruster, a software developed by Microsoft Gold certified partner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manual editing of registry will not be discussed in this article due to its high risk of damaging the system. However, you can still have a look on the following link to know more about it. </span></p>

<p><b>STEP 4: UPDATE THE DRIVERS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dwm.exe errors may be caused by corrupt or outdated hardware drivers of your PC. With updated drivers you can not only solve dwm.exe errors but also improve the speed and performance of your PC.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smartphone manufacturers may have changed the meaning of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the worst. But unbeknownst to many, it has a way deeper meaning for other fields of science.</p>
<p>AI helps scientists to forecast the weather or prompt pilots for the incoming planes. In the business side, AI aid investors in making trading decisions faster than any human being capable of. It also assists manufacturers for accurate and faster production rates.</p>
<p>Now, in a rather spine-chilling (but certainly useful) turn, artificial intelligence can now accurately predict our own death.</p>
<p>The recent study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0029-1#Sec3">Digital Medicine</a> highlights the use of AI to predict patient’s mortality rate 24 hours after hospital admission. The new Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently under the development of Google Medical Brain team.</p>
<p>In one instance reported in the study, a woman with late-stage breast cancer was admitted to hospital. Upon arrival, they found out that her lungs were filled with fluid, and so several doctors were called to evaluate. The hospital’s assessment claimed that she had 9.3 percent chance of dying during her stay. But this is solely based on her vital signs, disregarding all the previous data taken.</p>
<p>Google’s AI ran its own evaluation on the same patient, analyzing 175,639 data points on her record. Some of the data points include records doctors don&#8217;t normally consider during patient evaluation. But the AI was able to access it and add it on its assessment. These records include PDFs of notes made by doctors and nurses that indicate evidence of malignant pleural effusions (or fluid build-up around the lungs) and potential risk of pressure ulcers.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, prior work has focused on a subset of features available in the EHR [electronic health record], rather than on all data available in an EHR,&#8221; the authors wrote in their study. &#8220;Which includes clinical free-text notes, as well as large amounts of structured and semi-structured data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google’s new AI system is capable enough to analyze and process large amounts of data, both structured and unstructured, with more accurate predictions. In fact, up to 93-95 percent accuracy rate versus hospital&#8217;s current predictive model which is only about 85-86 percent accurate.</p>
<p>Taken into account all the data available for the patient, the AI was able to lift the patient’s risk of dying during her stay to 19.9 percent. Sadly, she died 10 days after admission.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although Apple is always improving security to keep its devices safe, the iOS can still be hacked and infected by malware. In fact, unauthorized users can gain entry into your device remotely via iCloud. There is so much you can do to protect your iPhone from potential hackers and malware.</p>
<p>If you think iOS platform is not vulnerable and is very secure, you&#8217;re probably wrong. As platform&#8217;s popularity rose, so did its allure to miscreants. The number of malicious apps on the App Store is lot less than &#8220;Wild West&#8221; of the Google Play store. However, hackers have found other ways to get malware installed. Skycure, the leader in mobile threat defense, <a href="https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/skycure-mobile-threat-intelligence-report-q1-2017-en.pdf">report</a> lists the following methods and examples of threats that exploited them to infiltrate devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Via App Store (example known campaign includes XcodeGhost)</li>
<li>Via malicious app using Apple-approved certificate (example known campaign includes AceDeceiver)</li>
<li>Via sideloaded app (example known campaign includes Yispecter)</li>
<li>Via jailbroken device (example known campaign includes Xsser mRAT)</li>
<li>Via cable (example known campaigns include Wirelurker, Malicious Chargers)</li>
<li>Via malicious settings (example known campaign includes Malicious Profiles)</li>
<li>By leveraging an OS vulnerability (example known campaign includes Pegasus)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the report, the percentage of enterprise iOS devices that have malicious apps installed today has more than tripled since Q3 2016. In comparison, the rate of Android malware infections has stayed relatively flat.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29859" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ways-to-infect-iOS-with-malware.jpg" alt="Ways to infect iOS with malware" width="648" height="645" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ways-to-infect-iOS-with-malware.jpg 648w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ways-to-infect-iOS-with-malware-150x150.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ways-to-infect-iOS-with-malware-300x300.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ways-to-infect-iOS-with-malware-75x75.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /></p>
<p>Here are the dos and don’ts:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Never Jailbreak Your Device</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29850" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Never-Jailbreak-iOS-device.jpg" alt="Never Jailbreak iOS device" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Never-Jailbreak-iOS-device.jpg 1000w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Never-Jailbreak-iOS-device-150x84.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Never-Jailbreak-iOS-device-300x169.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Never-Jailbreak-iOS-device-768x432.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Never-Jailbreak-iOS-device-750x422.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Jailbreaking your iOS device allows you to access apps outside the <a href="https://devsjournal.com/category/apple">Apple</a> ecosystem. However, it also makes your device more vulnerable to malware. In most cases, jailbroken devices get viruses when users download apps from unreliable sources. You are therefore advised to avoid tampering with your iOS device in any way and only get authentic apps.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Always Keep Your iOS Device Updated</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29851" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Always-keep-your-iOS-device-updated-to-prevent-malware.jpg" alt="Always keep your iOS device updated to prevent malware" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Always-keep-your-iOS-device-updated-to-prevent-malware.jpg 1000w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Always-keep-your-iOS-device-updated-to-prevent-malware-150x84.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Always-keep-your-iOS-device-updated-to-prevent-malware-300x169.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Always-keep-your-iOS-device-updated-to-prevent-malware-768x432.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Always-keep-your-iOS-device-updated-to-prevent-malware-750x422.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Regularly updating your iOS device is a sure way to keep it safe from malware and potential hackers. Every update comes with improved security features to help protect your iOS device from viruses. Go to the General Settings of your device and tap Software Update to download the most recent iOS version available.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Install an Anti-Malware App</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29852" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/iOS-Anti-Malware-virus-apps-download.jpg" alt="iOS Anti Malware virus apps download" width="1000" height="461" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/iOS-Anti-Malware-virus-apps-download.jpg 1000w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/iOS-Anti-Malware-virus-apps-download-150x69.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/iOS-Anti-Malware-virus-apps-download-300x138.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/iOS-Anti-Malware-virus-apps-download-768x354.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/iOS-Anti-Malware-virus-apps-download-750x346.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Consider installing an anti-<a href="https://devsjournal.com/how-to-remain-safe-from-android-malware.html">malware</a> application to keep your iOS device protected. You can download a reputable antivirus application from the App Store. Before installing an anti-malware app read reviews and choose the one that perfectly suits your device. Additionally, go for an anti-malware app that can scan your iOS device in real time.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Use Two-Factor Authentication</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29853" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-use-Apple-two-factor-Authentication-to-prevent-Malware.jpg" alt="How to use Apple two factor Authentication to prevent Malware" width="1000" height="641" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-use-Apple-two-factor-Authentication-to-prevent-Malware.jpg 1000w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-use-Apple-two-factor-Authentication-to-prevent-Malware-150x96.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-use-Apple-two-factor-Authentication-to-prevent-Malware-300x192.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-use-Apple-two-factor-Authentication-to-prevent-Malware-768x492.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-use-Apple-two-factor-Authentication-to-prevent-Malware-750x481.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Enabling the two-factor authentication feature on your iOS device helps secure your Apple ID. Once you’ve set up this feature, you’ll only be able to log in to another iOS device, say a new iPhone, through a trusted device. When you use your <a href="https://devsjournal.com/qualcomms-answer-apples-face-id-might-debut-samsung-xiaomi-flagships-next-year.html">Apple ID</a> to sign in to the new phone for the first time, an approval notification message will be sent to the trusted device.</p>
<p>This option gives you the opportunity to deny or approve login attempts into your Apple ID account. To enable the feature, go to Settings on your iOS device, select Password &amp; Security and switch on Two-Factor Authentication.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Use Strong </strong><b>Passwords</b></h3>
<p>Apple now has six-digit passcodes for improved security. Unlike the old four-digit passcodes, six-digit passcodes are stronger and almost impossible to crack. Ensure that your six-digit passcode has both letters and numbers. Investing in a passcode manager may be a good idea. In addition to helping you set up strong passcodes for your iPhone, a passcode manager can help you change passwords regularly.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Set Your iOS Device to Self-Destruct</strong></h3>
<p>Go to Settings and enable your device to self-destruct when someone enters the wrong passcode repeatedly. This feature prompts your device to erase everything after ten failed passcode attempts. Go to Settings and enable Erase Data to turn on the self-destruct feature.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Remove Unknown Profiles</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29855" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-Malicious-profile-from-iOS.jpg" alt="Remove Malicious profile from iOS" width="650" height="488" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-Malicious-profile-from-iOS.jpg 650w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-Malicious-profile-from-iOS-150x113.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-Malicious-profile-from-iOS-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Most of the time, when downloading third-party applications outside of the Apple ecosystem, you are required to install several unknown profiles and grant them special access rights as well. This leaves your iOS device exposed and increases its vulnerability to malware. To secure your device from malware, only give permissions to authentic profiles. To remove any unknown ones, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Profiles on your device and choose “Delete Profile.”</p>
<h3><strong>8. Never Connect Your Device to Networks and Devices You Don’t Trust</strong></h3>
<p>Your iOS device can get malware if it is connected to an infected system or an unreliable network. For this reason, stick to secure Wi-Fi networks and systems on your iPhone or at least do your browsing through a VPN, a <a href="https://nordvpn.com/what-is-a-vpn/">network which encrypts (secures) data</a>. The Skycure report also examined the risk of network exposure on iOS devices, finding the following in Q1 of this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS devices in Europe connect to more risky networks and experience a higher rate of network incidents than iOS devices in the US</li>
<li>iPads are much less likely to connect to risky networks than iPhones. About 39 percent of iPhones experienced risky network incidents, averaging over seven incidents per affected device, while only 25 percent of iPads were exposed, averaging only five incidents each.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any typical organization, about 21 percent of all mobile devices will be exposed to a network threat in the first month of security monitoring. This number goes to 41 percent over the next three months.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Reset Your iOS Device</strong></h3>
<p>If your device is infected by malware, reset its network settings and erase all data. This can be done from Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset. From here, you can reboot and delete all settings and content from your iOS device.</p>
<p>In case your phone isn’t responsive, try hard-resetting it. This can be done by long-pressing the Power key to turn it off. Similarly, you may long-press the Volume Down and Power buttons simultaneously to hard-reset your iOS device.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Don’t Open Suspicious Pop-ups and Emails</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29854" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-prevent-iOS-Suspicious-popups.jpg" alt="How to prevent iOS Suspicious popups" width="780" height="519" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-prevent-iOS-Suspicious-popups.jpg 780w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-prevent-iOS-Suspicious-popups-150x100.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-prevent-iOS-Suspicious-popups-300x200.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-prevent-iOS-Suspicious-popups-768x511.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-to-prevent-iOS-Suspicious-popups-750x499.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p>Hackers can install malware in your iOS remotely through emails and links. Never open emails, <a href="https://devsjournal.com/install-run-imessages-windows-pc-without-jailbreak.html">messages</a>, and links from suspicious sources or sources you don’t trust. Every time you are on the internet, only click on links if you know where they are leading.</p>
<p>In case you receive messages or emails from unfamiliar numbers and suspicious email addresses, simply delete them. Additionally, if you receive messages that contain random links or suspicious texts, just ignore and erase them.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>Most Apple users assume that their iOS devices cannot be infected by malware or hacked. Note that hacks and malware attacks happen all the time, and jailbroken devices are the most targeted. However, your iOS device can stay safe from malware if you implement the above tips.</p>

<p>Microsoft Silverlight may throw up a number of DLL errors in the cause of its running or due to its inability to find necessary resources rewired for the effective functioning of the software and plug-in. More often than not, users will face the Silverlight.configurationUI.dll error as well as the Agcore.dll errors. The error may be displayed as “Silverlight can’t start because msvbvm50.dll is missing from your computer. Reinstalling the program may…” or “Error – msvbvm50.dll not found”. Irrespective of the way the error is presented, the main implication is the fact that the necessary DLL file is not available on your PC.</p>
<p>To solve the issue, you will need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for the appropriate msvbvm50.dll.</li>
<li>Download the compressed <a href="https://wikidll.com/microsoft/msvbvm50-dll">missing msvbvm50.dll file</a> and extract it to the desired location on your PC</li>
<li>Copy the concerned DLL file to the C:\Windows\System32 folder</li>
<li>Restart your PC and retry the process associated with Silverlight.</li>

<p>General problems with Silverlight involve random crashes when an application that depends on the software and framework is being used. Since Silverlight is very similar to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/ru/products/flashplayer.html">Adobe Flash player</a>, but not as advanced, the app continues to face a host of crashes when streaming multimedia or playing games. If you experience unexpected crashes, there are about 5 solutions you can try:</p>
<h4><strong>1. Deactivate and reactivate the Microsoft Silverlight plug-in</strong></h4>
<p>To start with, try to deactivate and reactivate the plug-in as the service may simply be malfunctioning. To do this, simply type in about:plugins into the web address bar and hit the enter key.

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29832" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TWRP-Wipe-Data-from-System-of-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus.jpg" alt="TWRP Wipe Data from System of Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus" width="700" height="477" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TWRP-Wipe-Data-from-System-of-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus.jpg 700w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TWRP-Wipe-Data-from-System-of-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-150x102.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TWRP-Wipe-Data-from-System-of-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-300x204.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now that the data has been formatted, Go to </span><b>Reboot-&gt;Recovery </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to restart the TWARP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 11:</strong> When you have rebooted with TWRP, download the dm-verity and force encryption disabler zip on your computer, and transfer it to your smartphone via USB. Next up, you need to go to install in TWRP and browse for the downloaded file and flash it.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29831" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TWRP-Recovery-install-No-verify-Galaxy-S9.jpg" alt="TWRP Recovery install No verify Galaxy S9" width="700" height="478" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TWRP-Recovery-install-No-verify-Galaxy-S9.jpg 700w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TWRP-Recovery-install-No-verify-Galaxy-S9-150x102.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TWRP-Recovery-install-No-verify-Galaxy-S9-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 12:</strong> Next you have to reboot the device and set your account. At this stage TWRP is fully functional.</span></p>
<h3><b>Completing the Rooting process</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are still some more steps to complete the rooting process of Galaxy S9/S9+. The above steps has installed TWRP in your device. Follow the next steps to root the phone. Now rooting the phone can be done by 2 methods, by SuperSU or by Magisk. In order to prevent any app malfunction due to root, I would suggest using Magisk method.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Root Galaxy S9/S9+ using Magisk</strong></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29833" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Root-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-using-Magisk.jpg" alt="Root Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus using Magisk" width="1200" height="723" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Root-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-using-Magisk.jpg 1200w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Root-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-using-Magisk-150x90.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Root-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-using-Magisk-300x181.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Root-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-using-Magisk-768x463.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Root-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-using-Magisk-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Root-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-using-Magisk-750x452.jpg 750w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Root-Galaxy-S9-and-S9-Plus-using-Magisk-1140x687.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><strong>1) </strong>Download the <strong>Magisk 16.3</strong> modified zip file and transfer it in Galaxy S9/S9+ internal storage.</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">By holding the  [VOLUME UP] + [BIXBY] + [POWER] buttons , reboot your device to recovery.</span></p>
<p><strong>3) <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tap on the <b>“install” </b>option in the <b>TWRP recovery, </b>and browse for the Magisk 16.3 file you have just downloaded. Then flash it.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Once the flashing process is completed, reboot the device into System.</p>
<h4><strong>Root Galaxy S9/S9+ using SuperSU</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1)</strong> By holding the  [VOLUME UP] + [BIXBY] + [POWER] buttons , reboot your device to recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>2)</strong> Download the N965F_root_OEM_issue_devices.zip to your computer and transfer it to your device via USB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>3)</strong> Tap on the <b>“install” </b>option in the <b>TWRP recovery, </b>and browse for the file you have just downloaded. Then flash it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4) During the flashing process, the installer may ask for various options. You should remember that both “</span><b>OEM Patch</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and “</span><b>Root with SuperSU</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” are selected “</span><b>yes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this steps are done, simply reboot the device and this will make your device rooted with SuperSU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This being said, we hope you have got a good and resourceful information regarding rooting your Samsung galaxy S9/S9+ phone.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Android is an evolving operating system. It frequently receives OTA (over-the-air) updates released by OEMs. The OTA updates upgrade your devices&#8217; software and firmware to the latest version. OTA updates are released frequently, however, the only catch is that the OTA updates are not released for everyone at the same time. Usually, the OEMs roll over the update for a specific set of regions and users. The reason behind this is that the OEMs do not want their servers to be overloaded by tons of download requests. To ensure smooth downloading of the updates for all users, OEMs only release the update for specific regions and users.</p>
<p>It might take over a week or a month to receive the OTA update officially. And as you keep waiting to receive the update on your device, the excitement and the hype of receiving the update tends to fade away. However, you do not need to worry! OTA updates can be installed manually.  To install them manually you need to download the OTA update file and then install it on your device using ADB sideload. You can <strong>sideload android update </strong>and <strong>sideload firmware </strong>using the methods.</p>
<p>It is easy to install an OTA update manually. There are mainly two methods using which you can install the update on your device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install OTA update via ADB Sideload</li>
<li>Install OTA update via flashing through recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I will be explaining both the methods in detail. Moreover, I will be focusing on the method which explains <strong>how to apply update from adb</strong>. But before I explain the methods, you need to make sure that you meet certain requirements such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must have stock recovery. A custom recovery like TWRP is not going to work.</li>
<li>You must have ADB and fastboot installed on your desktop. You can download the program from <a href="https://devsjournal.com/download-minimal-adb-fastboot-tool.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Android USB Drivers: <a href="https://devsjournal.com/usb-adb-drivers-for-all-android-devices.html">Download</a></li>
</ol>
<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Method 1</span>: Install OTA update via ADB and fastboot</strong></h2>
<p><strong>How to apply update from adb</strong>? It is quite easy to install the update via ADB and fastboot. Make sure you perform each step precisely and you should have the OTA update installed on your device in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install ADB and fastboot on your desktop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Download the OTA update zip file and move it to the ADB and fastboot folder. (You can rename the file to update.zip for ease of access later)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29812" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Transfer-OTA-update-in-ADB-folder.jpg" alt="Transfer OTA update in ADB folder" width="699" height="493" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Transfer-OTA-update-in-ADB-folder.jpg 699w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Transfer-OTA-update-in-ADB-folder-150x106.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Transfer-OTA-update-in-ADB-folder-300x212.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Transfer-OTA-update-in-ADB-folder-120x86.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Connect your device to PC and Enable USB Debugging. To enable USB debugging, go to Settings -&gt; <a href="https://devsjournal.com/make-the-most-out-of-your-android-device-with-developer-options.html">Developer Options</a> -&gt; Check USB Debugging option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Go back to the ADB and fastboot folder where you moved the OTA update file. Open a command prompt window inside the folder. Hold Shift key and right-click anywhere on the empty space inside the folder. A menu will pop-up. Select the &#8220;Open command window here&#8221; option from the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> You need to confirm if your device is connected properly. Type adb devices in the command window and you should see your device in the list. If you don&#8217;t see your device, reboot your phone and make sure you enable USB debugging.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Type or copy paste the following command into the command window. Your device should enter into <a href="https://devsjournal.com/how-to-quickly-update-twrp-recovery-without-pc.html">recovery</a> mode automatically.</p>
<pre><strong> adb reboot recovery</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Your device should now enter the recovery mode. Use the volume up and down buttons to navigate through the list and Power button to select a highlighted option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> Use the volume buttons to navigate to the &#8220;Apply update from ADB&#8221; option and select it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29813" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Apply-update-from-ADB-to-sideload-the-OTA-file.jpg" alt="Apply update from ADB to sideload the OTA file" width="699" height="441" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Apply-update-from-ADB-to-sideload-the-OTA-file.jpg 699w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Apply-update-from-ADB-to-sideload-the-OTA-file-150x95.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Apply-update-from-ADB-to-sideload-the-OTA-file-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> Now go back to the command window and issue the following command to install the OTA update.</p>
<pre><strong>adb sideload update.zip</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> Once you successfully issue the command, the installation process should begin. After it&#8217;s done, reboot your device and you should have the latest version/firmware running on your device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29814" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adb-sideload-OTA-file-update.jpg" alt="adb sideload OTA file update" width="806" height="217" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adb-sideload-OTA-file-update.jpg 806w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adb-sideload-OTA-file-update-150x40.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adb-sideload-OTA-file-update-300x81.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adb-sideload-OTA-file-update-768x207.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adb-sideload-OTA-file-update-750x202.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" /></p>
<p>This is how you install an OTA update through <strong>ADB sideload</strong>. It is pretty easy and takes less than 10 minutes to install the OTA update on your device. The next method is far simpler and easier than the previous one. Follow the steps mentioned properly and type the commands carefully and you should have the OTA update installed in no time.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Method 2</span>: Install OTA update via stock/twrp recovery</strong></h2>
<p>To <strong>install OTA update directly </strong>via flashing, you need the stock recovery installed on your device. You can&#8217;t install OTA update through custom recovery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29815" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Install-OTA-update-directly-from-Stock-recovery-or-TWRP.jpg" alt="Install OTA update directly from Stock recovery or TWRP" width="1280" height="600" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Install-OTA-update-directly-from-Stock-recovery-or-TWRP.jpg 1280w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Install-OTA-update-directly-from-Stock-recovery-or-TWRP-150x70.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Install-OTA-update-directly-from-Stock-recovery-or-TWRP-300x141.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Install-OTA-update-directly-from-Stock-recovery-or-TWRP-768x360.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Install-OTA-update-directly-from-Stock-recovery-or-TWRP-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Install-OTA-update-directly-from-Stock-recovery-or-TWRP-750x352.jpg 750w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Install-OTA-update-directly-from-Stock-recovery-or-TWRP-1140x534.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step  1.</strong> Download the OTA update zip file and transfer it to your device&#8217;s internal storage.</p>
<p><strong>Step  2.</strong> Boot your device into recovery mode. To do that, turn off your device and press the Power button and Volume Down button simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Step  3.</strong> Select the &#8220;<strong>Apply update from SD card/Internal Storage</strong>&#8221; option.</p>
<p><strong>Step  4.</strong> Browse through the files on your internal storage and select the <strong>OTA update.zip file</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step  5.</strong> The installation will start and your device should be ready to use in the next few minutes. Reboot the device and you should see the OTA update installed.</p>
<p>These are the two methods using which you can install an OTA update manually on your device. Before you download and install an OTA update, make sure that the source is genuine and verified. Flashing faulty or different OTA update might damage or <a href="https://devsjournal.com/how-to-unbrick-mediatek-device.html">brick</a> your device. Also, make sure that your device is fairly charged before you carry out the installation process.</p>
<p>Now you do not have to wait to receive OTA updates officially anymore. You can install the update using the methods mentioned above. Stay tuned for more <a href="https://devsjournal.com/category/android/howto">guides</a> and tutorials! If you still have any queries, feel free to comment them below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mi has recently launched <strong>Redmi Note 5 or Redmi 5 Plus</strong> which is the successor to it&#8217;s vaguely popular predecessor Redmi Note 4. The Redmi Note 5 features a 5.99-inch display with round edge. The device is available in Black, Gold, Rose Gold, and Lake Blue color with a matte finish metal unibody. The Redmi Note 5 comes under the budget smartphone segment. It is also one of the only budget smartphones which comes with the bezel-less display. The device also offers a 12 MP camera which can capture sharp and crisp shots.</p>
<p>Overall the device offers plenty of features, however, if you want to extend the list of features and customize the device to suit yourself, you can try using the best custom ROM. To install a custom ROM, you will first need to root your device. <a href="https://devsjournal.com/guide-from-rooting-to-installing-custom-roms.html">Rooting</a> is basically giving yourself superuser access, which allows you to make administrator level changes to your device.</p>
<p>After rooting, you can either install a feature-rich custom ROM or you can flash kernels and mods to customize your device. You can overclock your CPU to make it run on its full potential. You can remove annoying bloatware and free up space. Once you have rooted your device, the possibilities are never-ending.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What is a custom ROM?</strong></span></p>
<p>Android is open-source. That means anyone can edit the code, recompile it and release it for a variety of devices. A custom ROM has many changes as compared to the stock ROM. You will find extra customization options as well as better battery optimization and consumption. Some Roms are more focused on device performance.</p>
<p>There are tons of Roms available out there which offer different features. However, it is very hard to pick out a ROM for your daily needs. This article features a list of best Roms for Redmi Note 5 so that you don&#8217;t have to scour the internet searching for best roms.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why use Custom ROMs?</strong></span></p>
<p>A custom ROM provides much better battery optimization and device performance as compared to the stock ROM. Also, the customization options are endless. You can <a href="https://devsjournal.com/download-install-xposed-installer-framework-android.html">customize every nook</a> and corner of your ROM. Mostly, people use Custom Roms to improve device performance. With time, your devices start to slow down. Installing a custom ROM which focuses on device performance might speed up your device as well as provide you with additional features.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><b>Prerequisites</b></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b> for installing a Custom ROM.</b></span></span></p>
<p>Before I move on to introduce you to the Custom Roms, please make sure that you meet the following prerequisites first.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need a Redmi Note 5 smartphone.</li>
<li>You need to make sure that your device is rooted and a custom recovery like TWRP is installed.</li>
<li><a href="https://devsjournal.com/backup-restore-via-adb-wifi-using-flashfire.html">Backup</a> all your data and device&#8217;s stock ROM.</li>
<li>Lastly, make sure your device has more than 70% battery left.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:  This post is meant for educational purposes only. The author or Devs Journal is not responsible for any bricked devices and damaged SD cards.</p>
<p>Now that you have met all the prerequisites let&#8217;s move on the list of ROMs which I have compiled and which I think will be ideal for your daily use.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things about the Lumia smartphones was its exclusive “Nokia Camera” app. Nokia developed it alongside other camera focus apps to improve the camera usability of its Lumia smartphones. What makes it special is the implementation of “pro mode” which lets you adjust the exposure value, shutter speed, sensitivity (ISO), focus and white balance with real-time visual feedback.</p>
<p>After Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia’s mobile division, it starts rebranding all of Nokia’s products. This includes the Nokia Camera app, which became “Lumia Camera”, only to be rebranded the third time as “Windows Camera”. Unfortunately, years later, Microsoft shut down its mobile division. Leaving the fate of the “Windows Camera” app in the hands of declining Windows Phone users.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to MWC 2018 in Barcelona, HMD Global, the Nokia brand licensee, made headlines for reviving the Lumia Camera app (which now they own the patent). Like the previous Windows Phone version, the revised version is only available for Nokia devices. That is if it has a Zeiss-branded optics, which doesn’t really mean anything by the way.</p>

<p>But folks from XDA developers have found a way to port it other Android devices that support Level 3 Camera2 API. Note that not all new devices support the Camera2 API, so you first need to check your device using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbeat.device.inspector">Camera2 API Probe</a> app. The app will let you know if your smartphone supports the Camera2 API and at which level.</p>
<p>Like some other ports though, the port version of the Nokia Camera sometimes won’t work 100% as intended. And the developer is well aware of the issue. It would sometimes crash on OnePlus devices, and visual feedback for the shutter speed is not working. Regardless, it will always work and produce the desired effect.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-nokia-camera-8-0260-50-pro-mode-t3798127">Nokia Camera (ver. 8.0260.50)</a> here.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A windows service is a program that runs in the background while a process in simplest terms is an executing program and are shared by services.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many a times there will be instances when a number of services will share a common process in order to reduce the resource consumption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The designers of Windows NT operating system  came out with the idea of bundling various services into one single process to reduce computing resource consumption.</span></p>

<h3><b>The build up for svchost.exe</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The designers of Windows NT (new technology) operating system had to take particular concern regarding for time and memory consumption while creating a process as compared to other operating systems like the UNIX family. Moreover, there were issues with the entire process getting crashed if any one service reports an exception. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">esoteric</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">problem had been reported by the users of the operating system who faced issues while updating the OS along with other hosted services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lead to the introduction of Service Host process (svchost) in the Windows 2000 version of the operating system.</span></p>
<h3><b>What exactly is Service Host process (svchost.exe) ?</b></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29762" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/What-exactly-is-service-Host-process-svchost-in-Windows.jpg" alt="What exactly is service Host process svchost in Windows" width="786" height="749" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/What-exactly-is-service-Host-process-svchost-in-Windows.jpg 786w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/What-exactly-is-service-Host-process-svchost-in-Windows-150x143.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/What-exactly-is-service-Host-process-svchost-in-Windows-300x286.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/What-exactly-is-service-Host-process-svchost-in-Windows-768x732.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/What-exactly-is-service-Host-process-svchost-in-Windows-750x715.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might have noticed that, at times, a number of copies of svchost.exe is running in your system. Now the question is what exactly are these svchost.exe? You are likely to not decipher why these processes are running. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make a straight confirmation, this is completely normal i.e too many copies of svchost.exe running at the same time is not an issue for your system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To explain in one sentence , svchost.exe is being used by Windows to encapsulate other essential components of the operating system. And hence, you definitely don&#8217;t want to get rid of these files cause it could make Windows not to work properly without any one of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Svchost.exe can be termed as a generic host process for services that run from dynamic link libraries like <a href="https://devsjournal.com/what-is-rundll32-exe-why-is-it-running-on-your-system-faqs.html">rundll32.exe</a>. The default location of svchost.exe is C:Windows/System32 . </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not familiar with dynamic link libraries,they are also known as the .dll files. These files are just a  big block of programming code which cannot load by itself and needs an executable file to load the codes it contains. The .dll files are getting more prominence in Windows ecosystem due to Microsoft change in approach of relying on using DLL files instead of internal Windows services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the problem with these files is that they can’t be launched directly the same way an executable file is launched. Instead these files are hosted using a shell that is loaded from an executable file. This in other words is the service host process, also known as svchost.exe. </span></p>
<h3><b>FAQs ABOUT svchost.exe</b></h3>
<h4><b>Why there are so many service host process running in the system?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might notice that Windows require a lots of services for proper functioning of the operating system. If all the services are bundled under one service host, there may be instances when failure of one single service may lead to malfunction of the entire system. That is why services are categorised into logical groups where each services are logically relative to each other. These individual groups are hosted by a single service host. That is the reason why you can find a number of service hosts running in your system.  </span></p>
<h4><b>Where is the svchost.exe file located?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This file is located in either the c:\windows\system32 or c:\winnt\system32 directories depending on your version of Windows.</span></p>
<h4><b>How can I view what applications svchost is handling?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple command prompt can help you find the applications svchost is handling. To do that simply run the command tasklist /svc in the command prompt to get the list of the processes or applications handled by a single service host.</span></p>
<pre><strong>tasklist /SVC /FO TABLE /FI "IMAGENAME eq svchost.exe</strong></pre>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29759" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tasklist-of-svchost-file.jpg" alt="Tasklist of svchost file" width="1377" height="739" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tasklist-of-svchost-file.jpg 1377w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tasklist-of-svchost-file-150x81.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tasklist-of-svchost-file-300x161.jpg 300w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tasklist-of-svchost-file-768x412.jpg 768w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tasklist-of-svchost-file-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tasklist-of-svchost-file-750x403.jpg 750w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tasklist-of-svchost-file-1140x612.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1377px) 100vw, 1377px" /></p>
<p>It shows you all the services assigned to each svchost.exe process. The PID column in the middle stands for <em>Process Identifier</em> and is basically the unique name for each svchost.exe process.  So you can slap open the Task Manager, click the <em>Services</em> tab and then sort all services by the <em>PID</em> column.</p>
<h4><b>Should I remove svchost.exe?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The svchost.exe file is an essential file of Windows and is needed by the operating system to function properly. Removing the file would cause the operating system to malfunction and hence it is recommended not to remove this file.</span></p>
<h4><b>Is svchost.exe a virus or trojan?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Svchost.exe is not at all a virus or trojan, but since it is a common program in Task Manager, there might be some malware programs which may infect this file by disguising itself as svchost.exe services. If you think your system is infected by virus that is causing problems with this services, then you might think to update your antivirus programme. However, if the antivirus program detects no such issues, your system is working good and the svchost.exe file in this case is not a virus.  </span></p>
<h4><b>Is it unusual to have multiple svchost.exe files running in my system?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely NOT. The Windows system may require several instances of svchost.exe depending upon the number of processes that is sharing the service. At any instant of time, the OS may need to access the memory and also has to communicate through the drivers. Based upon the numbers of different related processes running on the system, there will be different svchost.exe services running simultaneously.</span></p>
<h4><b>DRAWBACKS OF svchost.exe file</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though service process hosts reduce the use of resources in the system, it is not devoid of any drawbacks. To mention about the main drawback of this shared process is that if any of the services running in these shared processes raises an exception, it is likely that the entire process will shut down or crash. Moreover, it may also cause subsequent errors due to the services no longer running in the shared process. Besides this, a malware or virus may at times inject its services in an already running svchost service.</span></p>
<h4><b>How to detect a svchost.exe virus?</b></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29766" src="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Windows-svchost-is-a-virus.jpg" alt="Windows svchost is a virus" width="747" height="594" srcset="https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Windows-svchost-is-a-virus.jpg 747w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Windows-svchost-is-a-virus-150x119.jpg 150w, https://devsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Windows-svchost-is-a-virus-300x239.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, an svchost.exe is not necessarily a virus. It is infact a most important component of Windows, and Windows cannot function properly without this file. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these are certain malwares and viruses which disguise as a svchost service and infect the computer system. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If such infection happens, you might need to scan your computer. On completion of the scan if there is no suspections, the svchost.exe is fine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">However to be more precisely confirmed, you should check the location of each svchost.exe files. It should be kept in mind that the actual svchost.exe file resides in the c:\windows\system32 folder whereas the svchost.exe virus resides in c:/windows/temp folder.  </span></p>
<h4><b>High CPU Usage of svchost.exe</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High CPU usages by svchost.exe can be caused due to virus or malicious programs. You need to uninstall certain services or remove the malicious programs to fix it. The following steps can be followed to fix the high cpu usage:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Open the task manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Go to the details tab and right click on the svchost.exe service that is using high CPU usage, then click on Go to service(s).</span></p>
